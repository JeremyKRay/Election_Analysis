# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were **369,711** votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Candidate 1: **Charles Casper Stockham**
  - Candidate 2: **Diana DeGette**
  - Candidate 3: **Raymon Anthony Doane**
- The candidate results were:
  - Candidate 1, Charles Casper Stockham received **23.0%** of the vote and **85,213** number of votes.
  - Candidate 2 received **73.8%** of the vote and **272,892** number of votes.
  - Candidate 3 received **3.1%** of the vote and **11,606** number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Candidate 1, **Diana DeGette**, who received **73.8%** of the vote and **272,892** number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
As stated in the project overview, this challenge sought to answer 5 questions about an election by analyzing a csv file of election data. All questions were successfully answered using Python coding language and Visual Studio Code text and code editor. Skills learned include importing python modules into the VS code editor that could be called upon to execute various tasks. This included importing and saving the csv file to be edited. The analysis code incorporated the creation and delcaration of several variables, lists, and dictionaries and the utilization of loops that included 'with' statements and 'for' statements with nested 'if' statements. To view the results, we used 'f string' formatting. The full code can be viewed by clicking the following link. ![Election Analysis Python Code](PyPoll.py).

## Challenge Summary
This challenge covered Python coding techniques, building upon the logic skills and thought processes developed during Module 2 when learning the VBA programming language. These skills are necessary to do analyses on large data sets, regardless of the programming language. This data set had nearly 300k records and this challenge demonstrated the power of Python to be able to analyze large data sets quickly and effectively. It also further demonstrated VS Code's ability to allow a user to edit and test code.
